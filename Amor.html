        Hey, been a while.. Not really sure if you will open this or not but who knows taking my chances... So, how you been? Hope your doing good... its just that I really miss you and wish you would come back to me one day but this time with real feelings not sympthathy... Please know that my intentions here are sincere and come from a place of genuine emotions.
 I want you to know that I value the time we spent together. Our journey was filled with beautiful moments, shared laughter, and genuine affection (pretty one sided i guess) I wont deny that there been times I cried remembering about you and missing you. Those memories will forever hold a special place in my heart.
I genuinely wish you happiness, success, and fulfillment. May you find the kind of love that your heart truly desires. Your well-being will always be important to me, even though we've taken separate path
take care of yourself, [your ex ig]. The world is vast, and life is full of opportunities waiting to be explored. I hope that you find joy and love wherever your journey takes you.. Hope you come back to me one day :)
With heartfelt wishes and genuine warmth,
<br>
        <br>
Congrats on being with her hope you have the best time.. it hurts surely does but I mean your happiness matter more... Ig got rejected on being friends too... idk what path to choose anymore maybe death ig... Really wished you could come back one day but looking at you now happy thats just a selfish request of me.. have an amazing life aheadðŸ˜€.. Damn it still hurts alot but wont cry cuz your happy :)
[Your ex.. The boy who will wait for you]

        2 more days before its 1 month huh... times flies so quickly... from never leaving eachother to 1 month without eachtoher... So, heard your happier than ever so glad to hear that... Damn after nearly 1 year of loving no one you came i told you everything, how others hurt me and you did it prefectly.. Well your not to blame its my fault but if i could ever trade my life just to be with you for one last time I would do it with a smile and no regret. I wish I could hate you for leaving be angry at you for breaking my heart but I know your just a human going through alot learing about life and I just happended to be one of your lessons..+ Well the place I fought so hard to get out of I am slowly going there now... Maybe one day you will understand how much I love you and care about you I will treat you better than any of the person you will be with ... I never regret a single moment not even one of being with you... We sure grew apart but I will hold on to all the beautiful memories for us..If you are meant to be mine I will meet you once again in future when we both mature... We had such a small beautful love sotry huh wonder wished for our relation to end... Maybe you will never know how painful it was to see you go, see you leave me like I am nothing, probely you will not... It felt like i got stab by the person I trust me life with and thought never will be gone... My heart cries with aging pain when i remember you... Its not like I hate you but I wished I could not keep seeing you everywhere cuz its hurts and its feels like I am disturbing you I will give my best to avoid you so you dont remeber our past... Saw your story too September is sucidial prevention month huh what do you know I was going to kill my self cuz the person I love and was my last hope left, text you or call you if I am struggling? Damn I wish but you clearly blew me off like i am nothing, Maybe my life needs to full stop not a semicolon...I wish you the best and I will always love you no matter how much it hurts me no one will understand how much I love you, it even looks like I am lossing everyone I love, I will prbly loose that idiot too cuz of her crush huh you know who... Well no matter how much I write here its useless you will not be reading and hope you never read it either cuz you might cry I cant bear to see you cry now can I :) Good luck out there I will always wait for you Amor <3
