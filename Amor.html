    <p>Hey, been a while.. Not really sure if you will open this or not but who knows taking my chances... So, how you been? Hope your doing good... its just that I really miss you and wish you would come back to me one day but this time with real feelings not sympthathy... Please know that my intentions here are sincere and come from a place of genuine emotions.
 I want you to know that I value the time we spent together. Our journey was filled with beautiful moments, shared laughter, and genuine affection (pretty one sided i guess) I wont deny that there been times I cried remembering about you and missing you. Those memories will forever hold a special place in my heart.
I genuinely wish you happiness, success, and fulfillment. May you find the kind of love that your heart truly desires. Your well-being will always be important to me, even though we've taken separate path
take care of yourself, [your ex ig]. The world is vast, and life is full of opportunities waiting to be explored. I hope that you find joy and love wherever your journey takes you.. Hope you come back to me one day :)
With heartfelt wishes and genuine warmth,
<br>
Congrats on being with her hope you have the best time.. it hurts surely does but I mean your happiness matter more... Ig got rejected on being friends too... idk what path to choose anymore maybe death ig... Really wished you could come back one day but looking at you now happy thats just a selfish request of me.. have an amazing life aheadðŸ˜€.. Damn it still hurts alot but wont cry cuz your happy :)
[Your ex.. The boy who will wait for you]
